        <h1>FAQ and troubleshooting</h1>

        
         <h2>Q: All my jobs are failing. What can I do?</h2>
        A: open your simulation in simulation monitor and check the job minor status in tab "Jobs Summary"
        <ul>
            <li>Minor status is "Application execution failed": the simulator didn't manage to process your data. Right-click on the job and check for error messages in the application output and error files.</li>
            <li>Minor status is "Input download failed": maybe the input file you specified doesn't exist. If it does, then it may be unavailable: contact us!</li>
            <li>Minor status is "Output upload failed": maybe there is a mistake in the output directory that you specified. If not, contact us!
            <li> Minor status is "Retrieving status": information about the job is not available yet. 
        </ul>
        
         <h2>Q: Some jobs failed. Is it an issue?</h2>
        A: your jobs will be resubmitted a few times (6). Less than 10% of job failures may only indicate some turbulences on the execution system (e.g. a file is not accessible from 1 computing site or the simulator doesn't work properly on 1 site); you should get your results.
        If the error rate grows beyond 10% then check the previous answer.
        
        
        <h2>Q: I can't find the application I am interested in. What can I do?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your Account Settings and join groups that you may be interested in.</li>
            <li>Contact VIP support and ask for help.</li>
       
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Q: I have a beginner account. Do I need an advanced one?</h2>
        A: A beginner account will allow you to use most of the platform functionnalities. 
        You will need an advanced account if you want to have multiple application executions in parallel or if you need write access to group folders.

        <h2>Q: I have a beginner account. How can I get an advanced one?</h2>
        A: You need to get a personal certificate and to join the <a href="https://cclcgvomsli01.in2p3.fr:8443/voms/biomed/user/home.action" target="_blank"> biomed VO</a>.
