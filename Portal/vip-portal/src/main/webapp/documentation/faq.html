        <h1>FAQ and troubleshooting</h1>

        
         <h2>Q: All my jobs are failing. What can I do?</h2>
        A: open your simulation in simulation monitor and check the job minor status in tab "Jobs Summary"
        <ul>
            <li>Minor status is "Application execution failed": the simulator didn't manage to process your data. Right-click on the job and check for error messages in the application output and error files.</li>
            <li>Minor status is "Input download failed": maybe the input file you specified doesn't exist. If it does, then it may be unavailable: contact us!</li>
            <li>Minor status is "Output upload failed": maybe there is a mistake in the output directory that you specified. If not, contact us!
            <li> Minor status is "Retrieving status": information about the job is not available yet. 
        </ul>
        
         <h2>Q: Some jobs failed. Is it an issue?</h2>
        A: your jobs will be resubmitted a few times (3). Less than 10% of job failures may only indicate some turbulences on the execution system (e.g. a file is not accessible from 1 computing site or the simulator doesn't work properly on 1 site); you should get your results.
        If the error rate grows beyond 10% then check the previous answer.
        
        
        <h2>Q: My File Transfer or GateLab applet does not work. What can I do?</h2>
        A: Check
        <ul>
            <li>That you have the Java plugin in your browser</li>
            <li>...</li>
       
        </ul>

        <h2>Q: I can't see 3D models in the simulation editor.</h2>
        A: make sure that your browser supports Web-GL by checking the <a href="https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/sdk/demos/google/shiny-teapot/index.html">Teapot test</a>.
