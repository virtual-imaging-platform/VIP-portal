        <h1>Simulator Descriptions</h1>
        VIP hosts several applications but the following 4 simulators received special attention. 
        Don't hesitate to contact us in case you want to access another application.

        <h2>Field II</h2>
        FIELD-II has 3 inputs:
        <ul>
            <li>"ProbeParameters_mat" is a Matlab mat file containing parameters for the US probe to use and image to generate. It has two structures (names must be respected):</li>
            
            <ul>           
                <li>"probe" contains the probe-specific parameters:
                    <ul>
 
                        <li>f0: is the central frequency of the transducer elements</li>
                        <li>lambda: is the wavelength associated assuming a sound speed of 1540m.s-1</li>
                        <li>pitch: is the distance (in meters) between the center of two consecutive elements</li>
                        <li>kerf: is the distance between two elements</li>
                        <li>width: is the width of one element (note that pitch = kerf + width)</li>
                        <li>element_height: is the height of each element</li>
                        <li>focus: is the elevation focus of the transducer</li>
                        <li>n_sub_x and n_sub_y are the number of subdivisions in the lateral and elevation direction used  for calculating the elements response. They are field II parameters which are necessary if you want the elevation focus to be taken into account.</li>
                        <li>n_elements: is the number of elements of the probe</li>
                        <li>impulse_response: is the elements impulse response sampled at fs</li>
                        <li>dimension: 1 for linear of phased array, 2 for 2D matrix array</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>"img" contains the parameters specific to the imaging sequence. Note that not any kind of imaging sequence can be simulated. Only a linear array imaging, a sector scan using a phased array and a 2D matrix array imaging can be simulated. In terms of parameters : dynamic focusing and apodization can be used in transmit and in receive or multi focusing and apodization using zones can also be used.

                        <li>tx_cst_apo: set to 1 if constant transmit apodization is used
                        <li>tx_focal_zones: focal zones are used if dynamic focusing is switched off. Zones corresponds to the different depths of focusing
                        <li>tx_focus_times: Focus times corresponds to the time after which a focal point becomes the current focal point.
                        <li>rx_focal_zones,  rx_focal zones, same as previsously but in receive
                        <li>rx_apo_zones, rx_apo_times, tx_apo_zones, tx_apo_times : same as previsouly but for the apodization

        <h2>SIMRI</h2>
        <p>Simri (http://www.simri.org/) is a 3D MRI simulator based on the Bloch equation.  It takes into account the main static field value and enables realistic simulations of the chemical shift artifact, including             off-resonance phenomena. It also simulates the artifacts linked to the static field inhomogeneity like those induced by susceptibility variation within an object. </p>
        <p>Simri has 2 inputs:
        <ul>
            <li>"outputDir" is the output directory where the simulation results will be stored (a unique directory will be created)</li>
            <li>"inputZip" is a zip file containing :
                <ul>
                    <li>mdh/raw label file describing the object model</li>
            <li>labelToMatter.txt file - associates the labels used with generic matter names</li>
            <li>matters.xml file - associates physical values (rho, t1, t2, t2star and their standard deviation) to each matter type</li>
            <li>params.txt file - defines simulation parameters such as tacq, TE, TR, teta, pulsedur, seqname)</li>
