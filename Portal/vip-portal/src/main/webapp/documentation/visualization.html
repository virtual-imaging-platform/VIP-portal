        <h1>Visualization</h1>

        <p>You can visualize images directly from the "File Transfer" tab. Right-click on the image you want to visualize and select "View image" as illustrated below.</p>
        <p>Please be patient, the image may take a while to be downloaded and parsed before being printed on your screen.</p>
        <br/> <img alt="View image" src="visu.png"/> 
        <br/> 
        <p>The visualization tool is based on the AMI Medical Imaging (AMI) JS ToolKit (https://github.com/FNNDSC/ami). 
            It supports multiple file formats, among which Dicom (.dcm), Nifti (.nii, .nii.gz) and  MHD/(Z)RAW files.</p>
