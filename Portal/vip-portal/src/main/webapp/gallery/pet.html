        <h2>Simulation of the XCAT model with SORTEO</h2>

A whole-body PET acquisition was simulated using SORTEO. The anatomical and activity distribution models
were constructed from the XCAT phantom which was fitted to a specific patient anatomy. In addition to the main organs, XCAT includes the vessels and the airway tree which are necessary for high resolution simulations such as CT. The PET acquisition protocol consisted of a static 224s
acquisition and was described <a href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site/en/publications/MARA-11">here</a>. The scanner geometry was that of the PET/CT Philips GEMINI system (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH). The 18F-FDG activity distribution was obtained from <a href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site/en/publications/TOME-10">here</a>. Three bed fields were used to cover thorax and abdomen. Each bed field had the dimension of the axial field of view (FoV) of the scanner, i.e, 47 cm. The overlap between beds was set to 50% of the axial FoV to compensate for the sensitivity loss on both extremities of the axial FoV. List-mode data were reconstructed with one-pass list-mode EM using 5 iterations and 8 subsets, resulting
in 128x128x81 images of 4 mm isotropic voxels.

Two FDG-PET acquisitions (a healthy one and a patho-

TEO. The scanner geometry of the ECAT EXACT HR+
(CTI/Siemens Knoxville) was used, and 18F-FDG was the
radiotracer to study glucose metabolism during one cardiac
cycle. The simulated activities were respectively 45.1 MBq
for the healthy case and 43.8 MBq for the pathological case
as used <a href="http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site/en/publications/HADD-07b">here</a>. The raw data was corrected from attenuation
and reconstructed using a standard 3D filtered backprojection
algorithm resulting in a 128x128x63 3D image with a voxel
size of 5.15x5.15x2.42 mm.
The
appearance is close to a real cardiac FDG-PET image with
high homogeneous FDG capture in the healthy myocardium
and lower fixations for the pathological case.
